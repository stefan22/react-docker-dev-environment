# Local Development Environments

## Workflow:

- Create container image with our dev environment
- Run container image
- Work on project
- When we done, shut down container
- Next time we do some work in our project, start a new container
- Whenever we have to tweak out our environment, we create a new image

## Docker workflow:

- Our environment is clearly defined, and can be share reliably with others
