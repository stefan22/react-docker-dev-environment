## Images = files + metadata

### Image Metadata

It can be:

- an author of an image
- command to execute in the container when starting it
- environment variables
- etc

### Images layers

- Images are made in layers, stacked on top of each other
- Each layer can add, change, and remove files and or metadata

## Images vs Containers

- Unlike containers, images are ***read only*** filesystems
- Containers are encapsulated set of processes running in a read-write copy of the filesystem
- To start a container off an image:
  - `docker run`


## Docker comparison with object-oriented programming

- Images are Classes
- Layers are Inheritance
- Containers are Instances

> And since images are ***read-only***, the only way to create an image is by ***freezing*** a container.    
> While a container created by instantiating an image.




### Types of images

- Official images - Docker registry
- User (and organizations) images
- ***Self-hosted images*** ( not hosted in Docker Hub but on third party registries) ex: ***localhost:5000/wordpress***
  - ex: `registry.example.com:5000/my-private/image`
    + The ***root namespace*** is for official images (gated by Docker)
    + The ***User namespace*** holds images for Docker Hub Users and organizations
        â€¢ Ex: jpetazzo/clock  //***Docker Hub user*** is jpetazzo and the image is clock 


#### Manage/ store images

- This is done on your Docker host
- In a Docker registry
- Use the Docker Client to pull/push images from the registry



#### Show list of images in your host

$> `docker images`   //current avail images


#### Pulling an Image

$> `docker pull debian:jessie`    // pulls debian repository where jessie indicates the version tag

- By defaul tag refers to ***latest***

Ex:

`docker pull ubuntu`   // ubuntu:lastest



#### Multi-arch Images

- An image can support multiple architectures
- A tag in a given repository can have a ***single*** manifest or a ***manifest list***
- Inside of a manifest list, each image is identified by a combo of:
  - ***OS*** (linux, windows)
  - ***architecture*** (amd64, arm64)
  - optional: variants off arm or arm64, os versions for windows
  - ***also*** it is possible to specify the platform with flag: `--platform`
