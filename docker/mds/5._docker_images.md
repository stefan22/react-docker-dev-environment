## Images = files + metadata

### Image Metadata

It can be:

- an author of an image
- command to execute in the container when starting it
- environment variables
- etc

### Images layers

- Images are made in layers, stacked on top of each other
- Each layer can add, change, and remove files and or metadata

## Images vs Containers

- Unlike containers, images are ***read only*** filesystems
- Containers are encapsulated set of processes running in a read-write copy of the filesystem
- To start a container off an image:
  - `docker run`


## Docker comparison with object-oriented programming

- Images are Classes
- Layers are Inheritance
- Containers are Instances

> And since images are ***read-only***, the only way to create an image is by ***freezing*** a container.    
> While a container created by instantiating an image.
