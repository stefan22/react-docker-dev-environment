# Ex: Creating a Container image ...
   ...   ***OFF A BASE IMAGE with NEW INSTALLED PACKAGE***   

> <kbd>Docker Images are READ-ONLY - INMUTABLE</kbd>

#### I. Starting off with an Ubuntu container

`docker run -it ubuntu`

Adding new package: 

- Root@<my_container>:#/
                        â€¢ `apt-get update`
                        â€¢ `apt-get install figlet`


- Type `exit` //to leave interactive mode


#### II. Check for changes btw original image and new package just installed

We have updated the base image, and we'd like to keep these changes, thus we create a new image to 
include them in new image. But first we'll gaze - just for a minute or so - at our admirable work.  ðŸ˜¨

```
docker diff <containerID>  // it'll show u diff btw base and updated image
```

#### III. Commit changes

- We have exit interactive and do `docker commit <containerID`
- I found it easier to create a ***tag*** at this point  `docker tag ubuntito`

> Perfect time to get rid of some old containers `docker ps -a` and `docker rm 123 abc 456 789`.         
> Do not delete ***ubuntito***


####  IV. Test new Image and changes One more time

- Now `docker image ls` should show me all images in my host machine, including the image I just tagged
- Since I want to admire all of my changes one more time before going to bed:
    +  I'll run it in interactive mode again: `docker run -it ubuntito` 
    +  Do a message test: `#/figlet Hello World`
- That's going to show me a message and confirm to me that the ***figlet package*** still there and that i"m running this new image
  (I did select image with repo name ***ubuntito*** from a list of images afterall)
