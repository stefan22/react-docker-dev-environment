Able to get file into container







docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}/ui:/app node:13.12.0-alpine sh



 - it allows u to exec into container.
 - mount code in local dev into a container (ui-app dir)
 - access shell off linux container node alpine image

that gives u access to the container app

ls to see more
cd to app to find text file
